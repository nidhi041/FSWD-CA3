# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh






Project Setup
• Please download the codebase from the drive link: Link
• The codebase contains two folders: Frontend and Backend.
• Set up the project locally by running npm init and installing the necessary dependencies.
• Boilerplate Code: You are given an event registration system that allows users to register for events.
Frontend
• In the App.jsx file, you will find the routes for all pages.
• Inside the components folder, there is a Navigation.jsx file containing the navigation bar code.
• The following components need to be implemented:
• EventForm.jsx: A form to register for a new event.
• Eventltem.jsx: A component to display a single event.
• EventList.jsx: A component to display all events.
Backend:
• Inside the models folder, there is an Eventltem.js file with the EventltemSchema schema.
• In index.js, there is code to set up the Express server and MongoDB connection.
Deliverables:
Frontend:
• In the EventForm.jsx file, create a form to register new events.
• In the Eventltem.jsx file, create a component to display event details.
• In the EventList.jsx file, use Eventltem to display all events. Error handling is not required at this time, so feel free to skip it.
Backend:
• Inside Äflle you need to add MongoDB atlas connection string and verify MongoDB connected.
• Inside index.jsx file you need to write both post and get endpoints that will help in storing and retrieving the items
